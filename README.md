## What I Found Interesting 

Recently, a group of influential tech CEOs and executives from major companies such as Nvidia, openAI, Microsoft, and Google gathered with US senators on Capitol Hill to discuss the progression of AI as well as future means to implement regulations around AI. One interesting aspect of the meeting's demographic is that it also included some executives from the labor, civil rights, and creative industries. I believe that AI can disrupt any and every industry, so it's great to have fresh perspectives coming from industries outside of tech. During the discussion around AI legislation, Chuck Schumer brought up that there is "the need to do something (surrounding AI legislation) fairly immediate before the election". Generative AI and deepfake technology can make it possible to produce misinformation and propaganda on a significant scale, which can easily affect politics as a whole. Political interference through misinformation has already been witnessed in the last election, and I think that this can become exacerbated through AI if there aren't any guardrails put into place. 

### Fork comment
Good work Andrew! I also find the the issue interesting because it results in many more debates in philosophy regarding what defines a sentient being or how to treat AI morally.
