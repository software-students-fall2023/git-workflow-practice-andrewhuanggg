## What I Found Interesting 

Recently, a group of influential tech CEOs and executives from major companies such as Nvidia, openAI, Microsoft, and Google gathered with US senators on Capitol Hill to discuss the progression of AI as well as future means to implement regulations around AI. One interesting aspect of the meeting's demographic is that it also included some executives from the labor, civil rights, and creative industries. I believe that AI can disrupt any and every industry, so it's great to have fresh perspectives coming from industries outside of tech. During the discussion around AI legislation, Chuck Schumer brought up that there is "the need to do something (surrounding AI legislation) fairly immediate before the election". Generative AI and deepfake technology can make it possible to produce misinformation and propaganda on a significant scale, which can easily affect politics as a whole. Political interference through misinformation has already been witnessed in the last election, and I think that this can become exacerbated through AI if there aren't any guardrails put into place.

**Aditya Pandhare:** 
- I would say something I found interesting about this article was Google's response to how AI development and how it can be integrated to US Congress. Some of the one's I liked include generating policies which drive for innovation which I think is great especially for businesses and individuals, as well as pushing AI to solving global issues, some of the ones mentioned were cancer. I hope they plan to use AI to solve bigger issues as well using them to attain the UN's 20 sustainable goals. One that I found interesting however, was "driving greater use of AI in government". I'm not sure what they mean by that exactly, what motive does it have?
